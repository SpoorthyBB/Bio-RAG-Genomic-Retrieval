# Bio-RAG-Genomic-Retrieval
Bio-RAG is a RAG pipeline designed to solve a critical challenge in bioinformatics extracting accurate,context-aware answers from dense biomedical literature. Standard LLMs often hallucinate when answering specific genomic questions.This project solves that by grounding the AI's answers in actual scientific text using a vector search DB
